# Justly - A lawyer's office landing page
This is a lawyer's office landing page mockup project.
This web page was made with Ubuntu 20.04 + VS Code 1.98.2 + a lot of imagination and hard work.
Teamwork was also an essential tool to make things happen, so thank you to all my coding partners who worked with me so far.
